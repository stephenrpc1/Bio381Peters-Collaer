I sat next to Lindsey Carlson and discussed some of the problems with her during the lab period.

1.  This is the first question

```
Find: \h{2,}
Replace: ,
```

I used the h (for spaces on windows) wildcard with the quantifier {2,} to find any part of the table with more than 2 spaces (but ignore the line breaks).  I replaced these with commas.


2.  This is the second question

```
Find: (\w+), (\w+), (.*)
Replace: \2 \1 \(\3\)
```

Used quantifier surrounded by parentheses (\w+), to select the last name word, used that quantifier again to select the first name, and then used the .* expression to select the rest (university affiliation).  I then wanted to replace this with the second capture followed by the first capture and then the last capture inside parentheses.

3.  This is the third question

```
Find:.mp3 
Replace:.mp3\r
```

I selected the .mp3 at the end of each song name and included a space at the end of mp3 to capture the space between the next song.  I then replaced this with the .mp3 and a carriage return to make a new line.

4.  This is the fourth question

```
Find:(\d+)\s(.+)(.mp3)
Replace:(\2)\_(\1)(\3)

```
I used the capture around the number wildcard to specify the track number, followed by the space wildcard.  Then I captured the "everything else" wild card up until .mp3 which I also captured.
I then replaced this with the second capture (the song name) followed by an underscore and then the first capture (the track number) followed by the third capture (.mp3)

5.  This is the fifth question

```
Find:(\w)\w+,(\w+),\d+.\d,(\d+)
Replace:\1\_\2,\3
```
I captured the first letter with the single letter wildcard and then used the wildcard + sign to capture the rest of the word followed by a comma.  Then I captured the species name followed by a comma and then then used the number wildcard with the period and then a number wildcard again followd by a comma before selecting the last number.  I replaced this with the first letter of the genus followed by an underscore, then the second capture for the species and the last number capture.

6. This is the 6th questions

```
Find:(\w)\w+,(\w{1,4})\w+,\d+.\d,(\d+)
Replace: \1\_\2,\3
```
I used the expression I had from question 5 and added in the letter wildcard with the quantifier brackets to select the first four letters of the genus.  NOthing else had to be edited.

7.  This is the 7th question

```
Find:(\w{1,3})\w+,(\w{1,3})\w+,(\d+.\d),(\d+)
Replace: \1\2, \4, \3
```
I altered my code from before by using the quantifiers to select the first three letters of the genus name, as well as the first 3 letters of the species name.  I then also captured the first set of numbers.

I replaced this with the first capture followed by the second.  I then put a comma and a space after after this followd by the 4th capture and then the 3rd to reverse the numbers.
